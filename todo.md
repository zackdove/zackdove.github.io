# Ideas:

* Dazed beauty style logo
* 3d cubes into text, .. grow from nothing 1 by one
* a js spotlight type thing... i.e. screen is black, mouse moves a circle around that acts as spotlight to see stuff below https://codepen.io/raymondsiu/pen/XPzjbZ/
* move on scroll https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-create-frame-by-frame-moving-image-on-scroll-effect-30ce577c63c2 falling down, crumblind, block breaking with scroll
* on turn lights on screen, maybe have some wiggly stuff in bg?
* colour changes with mouse https://plinth.media/
* mobile responsive
* loading screen, maybe colours changing, then fade in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2342132/waiting-for-image-to-load-in-javascript
* prob make the bottom bit flex
* center 'loading' properly
* spotlight pulsing
* aniamtion on click favourite albums, favourite albums text comes to center, everything else fades (quickly), colour pulses quickly, could do this with all links
* 3d cube for fav albums, fav album on each side
* dont allow turning the lights off again


mobile responsive:
* need to swap between loading the diff set of images, no point both... or is there? could alternate
* darkContainer contents can just be changed in CSS via if
* darkContainer no spotlight... or could move around and then do it?
* darkContainer bg color pulsing slowly
